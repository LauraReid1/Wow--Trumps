# Wow--Trumps
Top Trumps card game

As my introduction to Python I joined Code Frist Girls 8 week Intro to Python and Apps evening remote class.  In the 8 sessions we learnt about Loops and functions, API's and app building, logic, lists and dictionaries. Then given a choice of projects to collaborate with. Unfortunately my partner took this point as her opportunity to exit the course unbeknown to me.

Armed with six hours of Python lessons and exercises I took on the project alone.

Using the MOSCOW method I planned how I was going to go about creating the Top Trumps game.  Very quickly I was able to write the code out in variables but near the end realised that functions would actually be a much easier and cleaner way of writing the code.  

I had to get help towards the end from a mentor.

Im so excited to now have written a piece of code in which two players randomly pull data using the pokemon API which is then compared and return the values and determines the winner.
